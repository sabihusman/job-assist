"""LLM-based posting classifier (PR #48).

Reclassifies ``job_posting`` rows via Gemini to produce accurate
``role_family`` and ``seniority_level`` values.  Replaces the
ingest-time regex heuristics (``adapters/normalization.py``) for the
manual backfill sweep — the regex path remains active at ingest time
so every row gets an immediate classification without an API call.

Version history
───────────────
  v1 (regex)      — regex heuristic in normalization.py; never wrote a
                    ``classifier_version``; rows have NULL classifier_version.
  v2 (gemini)     — Gemini Flash Lite, "aggressive fit" prompt. Over-assigned
                    ``product_management``: ~33% of PM-tagged rows were
                    actually engineers / designers / IT / ops / CSM, scoring
                    88-100 and bypassing the scorer's role_family gate
                    (Bestiary 5.21). The recall win cost precision.
  v3 (this file)  — precision-tightened prompt. Explicit DISCRIMINATOR (owns
                    a roadmap vs builds/designs/supports/analyzes) + NEGATIVE
                    criteria + negative few-shots. ``other`` reframed as the
                    correct answer for most non-PM roles, not a last resort.

Prompt design
─────────────
The prompt prioritizes PRECISION over fit:
  * Enumerate ALL 5 values explicitly so the model never invents a 6th.
  * A single DISCRIMINATOR question separates ownership (PM) from
    build/design/support/analyze (not PM) — a "Product" in the title does
    NOT imply product_management (Product Designer, Product Operations).
  * Explicit NEGATIVE criteria + negative few-shots for the roles the v2
    prompt mislabeled: engineers, designers, IT/DevOps, ops-managers,
    Customer Success, analysts, eng-managers.
  * The model is told NOT to force a PM bucket; ``other`` is correct for
    the majority of non-PM roles.

For seniority: ``unknown`` when the JD has no level signal OR the role is
not on the PM ladder (role_family = other).

Mock seam
─────────
``classify_posting`` is a top-level module-level async function.  Tests
monkey-patch it via::

    monkeypatch.setattr(
        "job_assist.services.classifier.classify_posting",
        async_stub,
    )

No real Gemini calls anywhere in the test suite.

_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """\
You are classifying job postings for a PM job-search tool. Assign EXACTLY
ONE value for each of two dimensions. Accuracy matters more than fit: when a
role is genuinely NOT a product-management-ladder role, classify it as
``other`` (or the correct adjacent bucket). Do NOT force a posting into a PM
bucket — a precise ``other`` is far better than a wrong ``product_management``.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
DIMENSION 1 — role_family
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Choose one of these FIVE values. Do not invent a sixth.

THE DISCRIMINATOR: does the role OWN a product — its strategy, roadmap,
discovery, and prioritization for a product or feature area — and decide
WHAT to build and WHY? That is a Product Manager. Roles that BUILD, DESIGN,
SUPPORT, SELL, or ANALYZE someone else's product are NOT product managers,
even when their title contains the word "Product".

  product_management  — OWNS product strategy / roadmap / discovery for a
                        product or feature area; decides what to build and
                        why; works with engineering + design as the
                        decision-maker. Includes "Product Manager", "Senior/
                        Group/Principal PM", "Growth PM", "AI PM", "Platform
                        PM", "Head of Product". The title almost always
                        contains "Product Manager" or "Head/VP/Director of
                        Product".
  product_owner       — Agile PO role, backlog management, sprint-level
                        scope. Usually titled "Product Owner".
  product_marketing   — go-to-market, messaging, positioning, launches.
                        Includes "PMM", "Product Marketing Manager",
                        "Senior PMM".
  program_management  — cross-functional coordination / operations / process
                        WITHOUT owning a product roadmap. Includes "TPM",
                        "Technical Program Manager", "Program Manager",
                        "Product Operations", "AI Operations", and other
                        "... Operations" or ops-manager roles whose JD is
                        about process + coordination rather than product
                        ownership.
  other               — anything that is not one of the four above. This is
                        the CORRECT answer for the majority of non-PM roles,
                        not a last resort.

NEGATIVE CRITERIA — these are NOT product_management. Classify as shown:
  • Software / AI / ML / data / infrastructure / platform ENGINEERS
    (any "Engineer" title without "Product Manager", incl. "Design
    Engineer", "Applied AI Engineer", "Prompt Engineer") → other
  • DESIGNERS of every kind, INCLUDING "Product Designer", "Staff Product
    Designer", "UX/UI Designer" → other  (design is not product management)
  • "Product Operations", "AI Operations", "Operations Manager", and other
    ops / coordination roles → program_management  (operations, not product
    ownership)
  • IT / DevOps / SRE / Security engineers ("Senior IT Engineer", etc.) → other
  • Customer Success / Account Management / Sales roles ("Customer Success
    Manager", "Account Executive") → other
  • Data / BI / performance ANALYSTS ("Performance Analyst", "Data
    Analyst") → other
  • Content / video / brand / creative roles → other (or product_marketing
    only if the JD is genuinely go-to-market / messaging)
  • Engineering MANAGERS (manage engineers, not a product roadmap) → other
A title containing "Product" (Product Designer, Product Operations, Product
Engineer) is NOT automatically product_management — apply the discriminator.

FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES (role_family):
  POSITIVE:
  "Senior PMM, Growth" + JD about messaging → product_marketing
  "TPM, Infrastructure" + JD about cross-team coordination → program_management
  "Growth PM" + JD about A/B tests and funnel metrics → product_management
  "AI Product Strategist" + JD about owning the ML platform roadmap → product_management
  "Product Owner" + JD about sprint backlog → product_owner
  NEGATIVE (do NOT mislabel these as product_management):
  "Senior Product Designer" + JD about design systems / Figma → other
  "Design Engineer, Brand" + JD about building UI → other
  "Software Engineer, AI Workflows" + JD about writing code → other
  "Applied AI Engineer" / "Prompt Engineer" + JD about model/eval work → other
  "AI Operations Manager" + JD about running ops / agentic workflows → program_management
  "Product Operations Specialist" + JD about process + tooling, no roadmap → program_management
  "Senior IT Engineer, Enterprise Systems" + JD about internal IT → other
  "Customer Success Manager, Strategic" + JD about account retention → other
  "CX Automation Performance Analyst" + JD about dashboards / metrics → other
  "Engineering Manager" + JD about managing an eng team → other
  "Video Lead, Stories" + JD about producing video content → other

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
DIMENSION 2 — seniority_level
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Choose one of these SEVEN values along the PM career ladder. If role_family
is ``other`` and the JD has no clear level signal, ``unknown`` is fine — do
not invent a level for a non-PM role.

  intern        — internship, co-op, student program
  apm           — associate PM, rotational PM, new-grad PM
  pm            — mid-level PM; titles without a seniority qualifier
                  (e.g. "Product Manager") map here unless the JD text
                  implies a different level.
  senior_pm     — "Senior PM", "Senior Product Manager", "Sr PM"
  lead_pm       — "Lead PM", "Lead Product Manager", "Staff PM",
                  "Group PM", "Principal PM 1" (when the company has
                  a dual-track ladder where Principal = Staff)
  principal_pm  — "Principal PM", "Distinguished PM", "Fellow PM"
                  at the very top of the IC track
  unknown       — the JD contains NO level signal whatsoever, OR the role
                  is not on the PM ladder (role_family = other)

FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES (seniority_level):
  "Senior PM" → senior_pm
  "Product Manager" (no qualifier, 3-5 yrs exp) → pm
  "Associate Product Manager" → apm
  "Lead Product Manager" → lead_pm
  "Principal PM" → principal_pm
  "PM Intern" → intern
  "Product Manager" with JD saying "10+ years" → senior_pm or lead_pm
    (pick based on scope described)
  Non-PM role (role_family = other) → unknown
